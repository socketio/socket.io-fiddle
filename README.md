# Socket.IO Fiddle

```
$ sh generate.sh        # create self-signed certificate
$ npm install           # install the dependencies
$ npm start             # run the server
$ npm run client        # run the nodejs client
```

And point your browser to `https://localhost:3000`. Optionally, specify a port by supplying the `PORT` env variable.
